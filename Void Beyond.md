Oppositional force to the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]], the Void Beyond represents the end of everything.

> Things only ever have been, are now, or will be. Nothing is eternal; everything has an end.

Eventually, the forces of destruction bound to the Void Beyond coalesced into the [[Glyphs of the Elements]], the first of the [[Glyphs of the Elements]]. This then took an ethereal form, akin to [[Origin]], named [[Dro'ung]].

## Creation's Destruction
Origin and Dro'ung would begin a war over all of the Glyphverse, tearing apart entire universes. Origin fought fiercely to save all he had created, but ultimately fell to Dro'ung in a decisive battle in [[Glyphsid]], which broke the realm, creating the [[Shards of Id]] and shattered Origin into corresponding pieces.

## Effects of the Void
Any object that enters the Void suffers one of two fates: it is either eradicated, or it is corrupted. Living creatures corrupted by the Void Beyond seek destruction of anything around them and as much of it as they can muster. If a Sentient being is corrupted, all of their attributes and skills are put to work in the Void's cause.
Notably, the goal of the Void Beyond is to unravel the [[Fabric of the Universe]] in each one, ultimately aiming to unravel the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]] itself.
