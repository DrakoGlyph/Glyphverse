*Glyphsid*, more casually referred to as just *Id*, is the central universe in the [[Glyphverse]]. It is home to the [[Champions of Id]], the [[Worldforge]], and the [[Prime Supercomputer]]. 

## [[Age of Mythos]]
The creation myth of *Glyphsid* begins with the dragon [[Origin]], who formed the world out of the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]]. He created the world as a shelter from the hardships and demons. It is said that the [[Glyphs of the Elements]] were tied to the creation of *Glyphsid*, each one acting as a font of the element it represented.
Origin would go on to create the landscape of the protouniverse, defining it from the Veil's chaotic energy.
It is here that accounts of the creation of *Glyphsid* vary wildly, but the only consistency is that Origin created [[Dro'ung]] from the [[Glyph of Destruction]].

## [[Shadowfall]]
Dro'ung was Origin's answer to disposing of his unwanted creations. Many would consider the demon akin to the Grim Reaper or even the God of Death. He hungered, insatiably, for the destruction of everything Origin had created, including Origin himself.
Shadowfall itself is the moment of Origin's death, when Dro'ung took over *Glyphsid* and opened the gates to [[Demonkin]].

## [[Demonsreign]]
The demons quickly overtook *Glyphsid*, subjugating the populace.
