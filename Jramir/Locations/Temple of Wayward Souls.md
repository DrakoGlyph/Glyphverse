The Temple of Wayward Souls is a shelter for all "Demonkin", those shunned by [[Dixtrae]]. It rests in [[Demon Hills]], a region populated with cherry blossom trees that eternally bloom.
The Temple used to be in the [[Sylvmyr|Lost Forest]], where the [[Kitsune]] within would guide lost souls to the afterlife. When [[Void Beyond]] endangered Sylvmyr, they called for help. 
A Rift opened between Sylvmyr and [[Jramir]], carrying the temple and the trees from the Lost Forest through.

## Under Threat
In the [[Third Era]], [[Evelyn]] made a large move to destroy the rebelling Demonkin, striking at their hearts by going after the Temple. [[Fuschia Starbright]], the Den Mother at the time, would lay down all of her powers, and ultimately her life, to give [[Kiko Oniichan]] time to escape with the children. The Temple was decimated, only ashes remained. Kiko would go on to defeat Evelyn, and get the children safely to the [[Dragon's Shelter]]
