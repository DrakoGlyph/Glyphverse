Often referred to as just The *Yggdracon*
Not to be confused with [[Yggdracon]]

After the death of Yggdracon, his body resting around the [[Yggdra's Seal]], the land itself reclaimed him, building steep mountains upon his remains. 

The area caught between these mountains and the [[Great Sea]] is known as the [[Dragon's Shelter]].
