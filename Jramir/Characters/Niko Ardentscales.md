Also known as *Niko the Ronin* and *Nikononamei*

[[Prime Kobold]] to [[Drachomere Ardentscales]], leader of the [[Kobold Faithful]], binder of [[Tenebris Umbrascales|Maldrachar]], member of [[Second Dragon's Guard]], leader of the [[Order of the Dragonflies]]

## Origin
Niko Ardentscales was, as all [[Prime Kobold|Prime Kobolds]], hatched in tandem with her dragon, [[Drachomere Ardentscales]], one of the [[Brothers Three]]. She would learn compassion and civility from her travels with Ardentscales until the dawn of the [[Great Dragon War]]

## Guild Ambassador
When Drachomere founded the [[Order of the Dragonflies]] in an attempt to unite the seven kingdoms, Niko was appointed Guild Ambassador. Often was it her duty as Prime Kobold to speak on behalf of Ardentscales, so naturally being a representative of his life's work followed suit. She would be instrumental in influencing the kingdoms to unite, forming the [[Rejavok Alliance]]. She was, however, an opponent to the [[Dixtraean Exile]].

## The Great Dragon War
The culmination of the Ardentscales' effort, the unity of the Seven Kingdoms, and the Order of the Dragonflies, would come under direct contest when the [[Great Dragon War]] was declared. The new nation of [[Dixtrae]], coupled with the [[Hand of Fate]], would wage war against the dragons. [[Tenebris Umbrascales]], unwilling to trust mortal races after they destroyed his home village, would splinter from the rest of the dragons, leading the [[Dragonsreign]] faction. Fighting a war on two sides, one against the mortals, and one against his own brother, Drachomere was overwhelmed. Watching his own kin fall would take a heavy toll on his psyche, and by nature of his psychic link, Niko as well.
He chose to sequester dragons in a pocket space within the [[Dragon Aeries]], the mountains surrounding [[St√ºrmhaven]], leaving the keys to the portal in Niko's posession

## Years as a Ronin
Niko would go on to lead the [[Kobold Faithful]], a band of kobolds who held true to Ardentscales's wishes, fighting against [[Order Scalefeller]]. It was Niko's orders that only after Order Scalefeller was destroyed that the Dragons be returned to Jramir.
It would take her years to track down all the known members, and in her quest she would often detour to help others along the way, leading her to become part of the [[Dragon's Disciples]]. It would ultimately be [[Sigil]] who defeated [[Thaddeus Fellvine]], the leader of Scalefeller, by burying them both in the lava at [[Dragonsmaw]].

## Death of Drachomere
Niko, excited to see her dragon again, would immediately quest to recover the keys to the Dragon's cage, and once she had collected them, she gathered the Kobold Faithful and set out for the peaks of the Dragon Aeries, but when she opened the portal, Drachomere and Tenebris were locked in a duel. Their opposing ideologies had only festered in their captivity, and the latter finally succeeded in destroying the former. From that day on, Tenebris was never called again by his true name, merely by the moniker *Maldrachar*. 
Niko would find herself aimless and depressed for some time, wandering the land seeking something to fill the void in her heart. Traditionally, a Prime Kobold would die, their lifeforce tied directly to that of their bound dragon. Wether because Ardentscales had prepared himself a Hallow, or because of the years spent away from him across planes, Niko found herself unbound by that particular facet in the magic.
She would begin a campaign of Dragonslaying after a time, any dragon still calling themselves a follower of Maldrachar would see her blade, until only their leader remained. For him, she prepared a singular punishment, worse than death. She bound him as a dracolich to the swamp he called home, [[Vilemire]]. He would live forever, but never be able to leave.

## Kobold of No Name
With no purpose to serve, Niko returned to the Order of the Dragonflies, serving as an elder council. She would no longer respond to the name *Ardentscales*. When pressed, she would simply call herself *Nikononamei*.
