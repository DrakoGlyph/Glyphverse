Also known as *Maldrachar*

Tenebris is a Black Dragon and one of the [[Brothers Three]]. He once cared for a mortal, but when she was killed by [[Order Scalefeller]] for harboring a dragon, he would turn against mortals.

## Dixtraean Exile
Tenebris would first become enamored with the mortal races during the long march known as the [[Dixtraean Exile]], where those who opposed the [[Rejavok Alliance]] crossed the marshy swamps of [[Vilemire]] to seek new lands on the other side of the [[Dragon's Shelter]].

This is where a young [[Lady Ourobouros]] would first encounter Tenebris. Young as she was, she didn't comprehend why her people were afraid of dragons, and thusly befriended him. He would check in on them as they crossed Vilemire, and even scouted the bay that would later become [[Tia'shu]], the capital city.

## The Snake Eating Itself
Lady Ourobouros would flee [[Tia'shu]] to avoid the intrigue that was killing her family. Together with Tenebris, they would wander the countryside, looking for anywhere they could help in their desolate countryside.
It was during this time that they founded [[Lo'shu]], the City of the Downtrodden. 

## Black Knight
Tenebris, enamoured with this human, would look after her and care for her. They would eventually travel into the [[Rejavok Alliance]] to hear rumors sifting over from [[Dixtrae]] that the Ourobouros family was dying. 
They would eventually sneak into a gala at the [[Order of the Dragonflies]], where Lady Ourobouros would learn that uer father, last known member of the Ourobouros family (since she was presumed dead) was on his death bed.
Tenebris would independantly learn of [[Order Scalefeller]], and the danger both he and the Lady were in. Together, they flew one last time back to [[Tia'shu]], before Tenebris parted ways with her, telling her his brothers needed him. 
That would be the last time they saw each other.

## The Council of Dragons
Tenebris was not the only dragon concerned with growing rumors of dissention between the mortal races and Dragons.
Some accepted that Dragons were innately linked with the nature of Jramir, for [[Yggdracon]] had created the realm after all. Some despised living, as they put it, under their thumbs. 
There was a massive assembly of Dragons in their home of the [[Dragon Aeries]]. When Tenebris presented the threat of [[Order Scalefeller]], the dragons decided on sequestering themselves from the world until such time as the Order could be defeated. [[Drachomere Ardentscales]] would task his [[Prime Kobold]] with the task before casting the sealing ritual.

## The Great Dragon War
When the [[Brothers Three]] emerged from the [[Sequester Seal]], each had stewed on their various experiences. Tenebris, bitter about the Order Scalefeller and nervous about the tense situation he had left Lady Ourobouros in, would immediately turn to fly to Dixtrae.
