This title refers to the first three Dragons born from the spirit of [[Yggdracon]], [[Drachomere Ardentscales]], [[Tenebris Umbrascales]], and [[Karat Facetscales]].

The three would be destined to intertwine themselves with the mortal races of [[Jramir]], and through their different experiences, each came to a different conclusion.

Drachomere thought that Dragons should protect mortal kind; they would benefit from the wisdom gained through the long life of Dragons. 
Tenebris would become endeared with but one human, [[Lady Ourobouros]] who was slain by [[Order Scalefeller]], igniting a hatred that would bring him to war. 
Karat buried himself in his studies, only communing with humans of like mind.
