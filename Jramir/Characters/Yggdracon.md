Legendary Dragon said to have created the [[Dragon Realms]]. It is his corpse that formed the foundation of [[Yggdracon Mountains]], his mouth became [[Dragonsmaw]], and his spirit became the [[Brothers Three]]. 

## Aspect of Origin
It is said that Yggdracon was created by [[Origin]], while other sources say he is a part of Origin. In reality, he is the bearer of [[Jramir|Jramir's]] [[Shards of Id|Shard of Id]], the connection between this realm and [[Glyphsid]].
