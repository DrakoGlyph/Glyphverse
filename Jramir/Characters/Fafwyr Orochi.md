(Disowned) son of [[Chiren Orochi]], Werewolf, leader of the [[Demonkin Rebellion]]

## Early Life
Fafwyr was slated to be the second child, and first male heir, of [[Chiren Orochi]] and [[Viper Ourobouros]], but she fell ill during the pregnancy, risking both her life, and that of her child. Chiren was offered the chance to save them by [[Dro'ung|a mysterious stranger]]. In exchange, he owed the stranger a favor, to be collected later.
While the stranger's actions did save his child, they doomed his wife. To this day, Chiren resents Fafwyr for this, that she had to pay her life, as he thought, so he could have one. 
When he turned eight, though, he had his first lycan transformation. When his father discovered it, he disowned his son as a monster, as both werewolves and [[Kitsune]] were considered Demons in [[Dixtrae]].

## Finding a New Family
Fafwyr was sent to [[Demon Hills]], where the Den Mother of the [[Temple of Wayward Souls]] took him in. Some among the temple hesitated to trust an outsider, and a cityfolk, but as Fafwyr spent more and more time among them, he felt less attuned to his human side, electing to stay in his wolf form permanently.
The Den Mother would one way send him on his way, "to his destiny", she assured him. He would run straight into the [[Second Dragon's Guard]].

## Dragon's Guard
Fafwyr would join the [[Second Dragon's Guard]], serving with [[Drakken Veilwood]] as his bodyguard. When not directly needed for conflict, he would busy himself cleaning the Guild Hall. He would be with the Drakkengard as they passed through [[Dixtrae]], where he would incite the [[Demonkin Rebellion]] with [[Fuschia Starbright]], a freed slave.
He would partake in the rebellion while [[Drakken Veilwood]] completed his quest, rejoining him with a supporting army of Demonkin.

## [[Third Era]]
Fafwyr settled in as Ambassador of [[Demon Hills]] to [[Dragon's Shelter]], where he would remain until the [[Battle of the Seal]], where he would fall, as general of the Demonkin forces, to the [[Hand of Fate]]
