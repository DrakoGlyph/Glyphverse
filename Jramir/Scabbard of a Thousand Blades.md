Legendary Item, made by [[Taggar Mythforger]], weilded by [[Avalyn]].

The Scabbard of a Thousand Blades is a steel scabbard lined internally with felt and folded into a pocket dimension. Much like other storage mediums, it can hold more items than its space would otherwise hold. 
When any sword is placed in the scabbard  it is sent to the pocket dimension linked with the scabbard, and the owner of the sword may pull it out by reaching for where its hlt would be.
The Scabbard requires attunement, and stores swords separately for each user, hence a sword one puts in there no other can access.
Additionally, if a sword is ever removed from the scabbard and not returned, the owner may pull out an etherial replica, which will shatter after one hit.
The scabbard comes stocked, by default, with steel versions of a Longsword, Shortsword, Zweihander, Claymore, and Dagger.
