Also known simply as *The Dragon's Guard*, before the Second Dragon's Guard was formed.

## Formation
When the fragment of [[Origin]] first manifested in [[Dragon Realms]], it chose the avatar of a young human paladin. His name would henceforth be [[Glyph the First|Glyph]]. He would go on to recruit the leaders of several factions who had found refuge on [[Jramir]]. He warned of a darkness coming, intent only on destroying the world in its entirety.

## Death of Yggdracon


## Protecting Jramir
[[Yggdra]], a young Ent who once hailed from the Realm known as [[Pyramyr]],  now the last of her kind, swpre to protect life in all its forms. She created a powerful spell to bind all the lifeforce in Jramir together, as a protective bond around the [[Shards of Id|Shard of Id]] buried in the shoreline in [[Dragon's Shelter]]. Combined with the power of the other members of the Dragon's Guard, she would create the [[Yggdra's Seal]], sometimes called by the name known to humans as Yggdrasil, an error she was happy to substantiate, for it threw off the tree's true purpose.
