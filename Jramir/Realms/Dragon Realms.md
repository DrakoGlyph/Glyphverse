After the defeat of [[Origin]], and the [[Shards of Id]] broke off, Origin used the last of their power to create worlds round each shard, to protect them from the [[Void Beyond]]. 
In [[Jramir]], this manifested as the Greatwyrm [[Yggdracon]], a collosal dragon who proceeded to shape the energy around the Shard of Id he was given.
