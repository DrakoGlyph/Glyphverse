Also known as *The Lost Forest*

Sylvmyr is the realm of Forest and Spirits. Those that have unfinished business among the living may find their souls here when they perish, and it has been the sacred duty of the [[Temple of Wayward Souls]], and the [[Kitsune]] within, to care for these spirits and help them move on.
Within the domain is an endless forest, prone to confounding with magic mist. Explorers report often leaving in a single direction to return whence they came without ever turning around. Often the best way to get anywhere in Sylvmyr is to know where you want to go, and the Lost Forest will take you there.
