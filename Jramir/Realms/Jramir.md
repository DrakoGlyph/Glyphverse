#World 

Jramir is a part of the [[Dragon Realms]], the last creation of [[Yggdracon]] before he was slain. It is connected both to the other realms and to the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]], which causes unstable Wild Magic at the extent of the realm.

It's centered at the [[Yggdra's Seal]], a tree bound to all life in the realm, and holding it from being consumed by either cosmic force.
