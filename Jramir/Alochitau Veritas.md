Last of a Race known as [[Kuran]], older brother to [[Enigma Veritas]], apprentice to [[Yggdra]], keeper of the [[Dragonslore]]

Alochitau, or Aloe, is a [[Kuran]] Elf, known for their healing abilities. Aloe capitalized on this by furthering his study of Life Magic and Water Magic. 

## Personality
Often self-sure but quiet, Aloe is often mistaken as timid or shy. He is a man of eloquence when in confortable company, and a sagacious leader of the [[Drakkensgard]], a responisbility he takes seriously.

## Origins
Aloe, and the Veritas family, originally hail from another time and world. He is but one of numerous survivors brought to [[Jramir]] as their last sanctuary from the [[Void Beyond]]. 
His people settled into the [[Dragon's Shelter]], forming a town known as [[Divinity]]. It was later destroyed in a battle against [[Dro'ung]], leaving only a cursed region known now as the [[Mystivore]]. Tired of loss, he took apprenticeship with [[Yggdra]] in hopes that he could spare further suffering.
