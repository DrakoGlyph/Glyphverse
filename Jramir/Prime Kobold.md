Prime Kobolds are a special subspecies of Kobold with an enhanced bond with a dragon. Each dragon hatched simultaneously with a kobold destined to be their Prime Kobold. Usually a Prime is the speaker for the dragon in matters where the appearance of the dragon may cause commotion or undue stress. They also serve as the primary hand of their dragon, fulfilling any request given to them.
Typically, when a Dragon dies, the bond between them and their Kobold severs the lifeline of the Kobold in question, thus lifebonding them.
