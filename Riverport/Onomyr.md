Land of Stone, one of the [[Dragon Realms]]. 

Original hone of the Dwarves until [[Dro'ung]] and the [[Void Beyond]] started encroaching. The Dwarven King, [[Taggar Mythforger]], would combine his people's power to conjure a Rift, which would take the whole of [[Stürmhaven]] to another realm, [[Jramir]], specifically.

The remains of the realm consist of an unimaginable amount of stone, wherein lies an abyss, where the Rift to the [[Void Beyond]] opened below Stürmhaven.
