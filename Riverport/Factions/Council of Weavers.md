The Council of Weavers is a collection of Weavers from across the [[Riverport (Metaverse)]]. They convene to discuss Multiversal threats. They are led by the [[Prime Weaver]], an elected member of the council to guide discourse and maintain order in the court.

## Founding

In the aftermath of the [[Reckoning]], with [[Exile]] in control of [[Melissa Weaver]], the seams of [[Riverport (Prime Canon)]] were being torn apart. [[Melbourne Weaver]], weakened since [[The Fray]], dove into the [[Silk Roads]], looking for any help he could find along the way. He would, invariably, encounter the Weaver of each universe he came across, and together they would create the Council. United, the Weavers, Melissa included, would turn the tables on Exile, expelling him from her. They would then banish him beyond the Silk Roads into the [[Void Beyond]]
