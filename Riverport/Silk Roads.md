The Silk Roads is a sort of dimensional filler between Universes in the [[Riverport (Metaverse)]]. It is an extension, or clipping one might say, of the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]], specifically, only possibilities containing a version of [[Riverport (City)]]

## Connection to The Weaver
Within each Universe is a singular instance of the [[Fabric of the Universe]], a component of the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]]. It was first discovered in Ancient Greece, when the [[Loom of Fate]] was created, but the power of the Weaver, the mortal being who could read and manipulate the [[Threads of Fate]], would come from a much different civilization. It was oral tradition passed down from the earliest of mankind, and the sacred [[Book of Fate]] was made by the African Trickster God Anansi, lost on Earth to be found by the first Weaver. 
It was passed, mother to daughter, until modern day, when [[Melissa Weaver]] in [[Riverport (Prime Canon)]], and [[Melbourne Weaver]] in [[Universe 63]] et al obtained it. 
True to the work of any trickster god, only the bearer of the [[Book of Fate]] can use the powers of [[The Weaver]]. One of the many powers granted to a Weaver is the ability to traverse the Silk Roads.
