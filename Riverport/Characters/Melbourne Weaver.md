Also known as *Weaver 63*

Melbourne Weaver is the Weaver of [[Universe 63]]. He recieved the [[Book of Fate]] for his universe on his eighteenth birthday, and began studying the powers immediately. 

## [[Weaver and Weaver (Storyline)|Weaver and Weaver]]
When [[Melissa Weaver]] fell into his universe, he was alerted by the [[Threads of Fate]]. Thinking he was about to face some multiversal threat, he immediately investigated. To his surprise, it was but another Weaver, fallen through the [[Silk Roads]].
His curiousity was piqued, and he offered to help her get used to her powers. Together, they worked out a way to keep a door open between their universes by stitching together the back doors of their shops.

## [[The Fray]]
When [[Sköll]] sought to steal the [[Loom of Fate]] from [[Weaver and Weaver Tailoring]], Melbourne was the only hero available to thwart them. 
Outmatched in raw power, he gambled that his own versions of [[Hati]] and Sköll would be up to the same idea. He led the werewolves through the joined door into [[Universe 63]], where Sköll viciously attacked his own alternate. 
Sköll would then make moves for the Loom again, and when met with opposition from both Melbourne and Hati, he burned down the shop, Melbourne still inside.
Sköll would then fail to use the Loom properly, damaging the Fabric of the Universe, causing the event known as [[The Fray]].
