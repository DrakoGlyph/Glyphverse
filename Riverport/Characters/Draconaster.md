Also known as *The Constellation Draco*, *Ambassador of the Stars*

Draconaster is a member of the [[Constellations]], a group of celestial beings brought to life through the collective power of human imagination.

## Creation
All of the Constellations share an origin: humans looking into the stars and seeing images traced between them. The fact that humans all over the globe do this, combined with the latent energies both natural and fostered, gave rise to the earliest Constellations, Draco counts himself among that number.
When the Internation Astronomical Union officially defined the 88 Constellations, however, the once disorganized group gained a concrete definition.

## Adoring Humans
Draconaster, being one of the older and more consistent Constellations, has enjoyed a long life watching over the inhabitants of the planet that creates him, but watching from the sky can only show you so kuch of what life on Earth is like.
He would learn to store his Constellation powers in a cape, adorned with his starry likeness, in order to take a human form and walk amongst the mortals. 
It was on one of these walkabouts that he fell in love, and decided to permanently reside on Earth.

## Sense of Duty
As he lived among the people, Draconaster would grieve for the many tragedies that befell them, but he felt compelled to observe rather than interviene. It wasn't until his own lover was put in peril that he would risk himself for the sake of mortals.
When brought before [[The Zodiac]], Draconaster defended his decision, citing that humans were the source of their power and protecting them was the least they could do to repay that gift. Persuaded, The Zodiac would grant Draconaster the title of Ambassador of the Stars, and grant him permission to act on the Constellations behalf.

## Heartbreak and Kinship
Inevitably, Draconaster would outlive his lover. The curse of long life, however, would not weigh on the dragon. He cherished every moment, and knew they were numbered. He was fine, he would tell himself, but lonely.
He would find himself on [[Mount Sakura]], a botanical marvel of a mountain covered in sakura trees, and it was here that he would meet the hero [[Soulmaurai]], fresh from his own heartbreak. The two would bond and become close friends.
