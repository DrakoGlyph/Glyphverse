Also known as *The Constellation Draco*, *Ambassador of the Stars*

Draconaster is a member of the [[Constellations]], a group of celestial beings brought to life through the collective power of human imagination.

## Creation
All of the Constellations share an origin: humans looking into the stars and seeing images traced between them. The fact that humans all over the globe do this, combined with the latent energies both natural and fostered, gave rise to the earliest Constellations, Draco counts himself among that number.
When the Internation Astronomical Union officially defined the 88 Constellations, however, the once disorganized group gained a concrete definition.

## Adoring Humans
Draconaster, being one of the older and more consistent Constellations, has enjoyed a long life watching over the inhabitants of the planet that creates him, but watching from the sky can only show you so kuch of what life on Earth is like.
He would learn to store his Constellation powers in a cape, adorned with his starry likeness, in order to take a human form and walk amongst the mortals. 
It was on one of these walkabouts that he fell in love, and decided to permanently reside on Earth.

## Sense of Duty
His love was [[Lunabelle Moondancer]], a beautiful Kitsune, held great power. A prophecy foretold that she was a [[Fatebender]], one of the few beings in the Glyphverse capable of changing the [[Threads of Fate]]. For this reason, she was constantly unter attack by villains. Draconaster, grief in his heart, decided to seal her in the moon, so he could look at her every night, even if he couldn't hold her.

## Heartbreak and Kinship
After sealing away Lunabelle, He was fine, he would tell himself, but lonely.
He would find himself on [[Mount Sakura]], a botanical marvel of a mountain covered in sakura trees, and it was here that he would meet the hero [[TamashÄ« Haiku|Soulmaurai]], fresh from his own heartbreak. The two would bond and become close friends.
