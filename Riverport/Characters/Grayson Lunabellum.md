#Hero #Werewolf
Also known as *Fenrir*, *Wolf Arcane*

## [[The Monster at Summer Camp]]
Grayson, social outcast as most [Werewolves](Werewolf) are, is sent to Summer Camp at [[Lake Origin]]. It is here he first meets [[Lucas Kettleburn]] and [[Marion Baker X]], where they become friends, and band together to stop [[Sköll]] from unleashing an ancient curse.

## [[Veilwood Raid]]
Grayson and Lucas would continue their friendship through middle and high school, occassionally seeing Marion between her various extracurriculars and avoiding her Grandmother finding out. [[Marion Baker VIII]], leader of the [[Silver Bullets]], just like the Bakers back to the Age of Fairy Tales, despised werewolves.
The Lunabellums, at the time, lived in the [[Veilwood Charter]], a Werewolf themed community. A key component of the Charter was that the neighborhood was not to become "a nuisance", a nebulous term whose lack of definition would herald the end of the contract before it began. 
The Silver Bullets called on the Charter after the discovery of the [[Rogue's Gallery]]. Deciding that swift action would nip the problem before it spread to the rest of the city, they purged the neighborhood, killing a number of werewolves, but displacing all of them. This was the beginning of [[The Silver Wars]], and the schism that would eventually bring down the Silver Bullets.
Grayson, himself, was sleeping over at Lucas's on the night of the raid. He was suspicious when [[Nora Kettleburn]] recieved a call from his mother, but confirmed it on the news later. He would then run back to see his neighborhood burned down, [[Hati]] and Sköll amongst the ashes. Grayson attempted to console them, but this escalated the rivalry between Sköll and Grayson. The Kettleburns would then take Grayson in to let him finish high school and college.

## College Years
Grayson, predictably lost after the disappearance of his parents, who were never found after the Veilwood Raid, would be unfocused in college. Lucas would major in a number of fields, aided by his [[Artificier Gauntlets]], linked to the [[Babylon Archives]]. Grayson spent this time deciding who he would be, and took up the Fenrir mantle after hearing of increased crime in the area. It was also during this time that Lucas and Grayson began acknowledging their love for each other.
Grayson would go on to create [[Moonlight Investigations]], always hoping he can catch some hint of his parents, but vowing to help those who couldn't find help elsewhere.

## [[Moonbeams and Heartstrings]]
Lucas and Grayson would evolve their relationship, eventually getting engaged. They would invite the entire [[Weaver Network]] to their wedding.
The night before the ceremony, the happy couple's old friend, [[Marion Baker X]], showed up to warn them of the Silver Bullet's plan to destroy the wedding. Deciding that living in fear of the opressor would only let them win (and because every hero in Riverport was invited to the wedding), they persisted.
As if scheduled, just before the ceremony began, the Bullets invaded. It would take the strategic planning of every member of the Weaver Network to pull everyone through unscathed, but eventually Scarlet X and her crew of dissenters would stall the Bullets enough for ghe wedding to escape.
At Lake Origin, as if by fate, the two were wed, far from the meddling of [[Marion Baker VIII]].

## [[Blood Moon]]
Marion Baker VIII, humiliated by her recent defeat, hearing dissention in her ranks since the Veilwood Raid, was determined to show Riverport the monsters that they worshipped. Her perfect opportunity arrived in the form of the Berserker Comet, a strange astral anomaly that turned the moon blood red. It was this same comet, in the [[Riverport (Prime Canon)#Age of Fairy Tales|Age of Fairy Tales]] that revealed to the original [[Marion Lee Baker]] her grandmother's true form, thus beginning the [[Silver Bullets]], then known as the Silver Arrows.
In modern times, however, the deranged Baker in charge of the modern Bullets knew this was the perfect time to expose the monsters in the 'heroes'.
She would kidnap any werewolf she could and experiment on them with concentrated Blood Moon energy, driving their Wolf Within wild. Grayson would be captured by the Red Hood, and taken to the basement labs of the [[OnceAgain Corporation]]. He struggled against the experiments until Lucan finally rescued him. The werewolf's stamina had ran out, though, and he succumbed to the monster.
Artificier would do the only thing he could think of and expell all of their spirits using a technique he learned from an old college friend, [[Tamashī Haiku]]. Lucas would take the Wolf Within into himself, able to hold him back with the [[Artificier Gauntlets]] until he could calm him, showing him the fear he had promised never to cause.

## Blood Moon Aftermath
During the time immediately after the Blood Moon event, Fenrir would have trouble controlling his Wolf Within. Having been cowed by seeing the fear it inflicted, the Wolf Within took great insult to anyone who used that Fear themselves. In this conflicted time in Fenrir's life, the Wolf Within would lash out at anyone using Fear (including a cameo of [[Transition|Transition's]] father). Grayson would become quite reclusive as Artificier spent most of his time looking for a solution.

## Twin Soul
Pulling the last strings he could, Artificer called one of his old college friends, [[Tamashī Haiku]], who had studied the [[Plane of Souls]], and the the powers he could gain from it. Using the [[Sword of Souls]], and with some spiritual guidance from [[Tamashī Haiku]] and [[Draconaster]], on the top of [[Mount Sakura]], Grayson tamed the Wolf Within, but in doing so, was able to manifest it as a spirit separate from himself, a power he would keep the rest of his career. 
As a note, it was while the [[Weaver Network]] was away on this mission that [[The Fray]] happens back home.

## Mentor and Father
It's important to know that Blood Moon Fenrir interacted with Transition's Father, because he was abusive to her for being transgender. It was that night she felt peace for the first time in her life, because his father was too scared to abuse her anymore; he truly feared the Big Bad Wolf. It was because of this, when she discovered her powers, that [[Moonlight Investigations]] was the first place she turned. 
Grayson and Lucas took great joy in taking in the bright star that was Transition, housing her in one of the open apartments in [[Babylon Towers]]. They gave her the official position of secretary, for who better to run the front desk of Moonlight Investigations than an Empowered, capable of dueling any villain who wandered in.
They would eventually house [[Hati|Sundancer]] in another apartment, after her absolution. 

## Reckoning
There had been increased reports of animals attacking humans near [[Lake Origin]], and all the members of [[Moonlight Investigations]] answered the call to investigate, leaving the rest of both [[Weaver Network]] and [[M.I.S.T. (Team)]] to defend [[Riverport (City)]]. 
In the wilds, they would encounter [[Marion Baker VIII]], though she had gone mad from exposure to the [[Void Beyond]], which had promised her dream of ridding the world of monsters. Armed with a scrabbled together cannon capable of firing charged Blood Moon energy, she engaged in a final battle with Moonlight Investigations. 
Notably, Fenrir was struck by the Blood Moon Canon while alone with Artificer, who tried to reach Grayson behind the Wolf Within, while [[Marion Baker X|Scarlet X]] dueled her grandmother. Scarlet would not defeat her in time to stop *Blood Moon Fenrir* from killing Artificier. Grayson would come to his senses holding his dying husband in his arms. 

## The Wolf Arcane
His hisband dead, the [[Artificier Gauntlets]] lay unused. With the looming threat of [[Faux Pas]] and [[Exile|Ex-Weaver]] unleashing [[Dro'ung]], Fenrir needed every edge he could to not let his husband's death be in vain. He donned the Artificier Gauntlets, becoming *The Wolf Arcane*. 
As he was learning to use the Gauntlets, he would swear he could still hear Artificier's voice, feel his touch... he could swear he was still here. As it turns out, Artificier, having donned the Gauntlets at such a young age, and having his entire life's memory stored in the [[Babylon Archives]], was a Psychic Imprint. And given Fenrir's Soul empowerment, coupled with the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]], Artificier's Soul had been preserved.   Together, the three souls formed the Wolf Arcane. Together with [[Melbourne Weaver|Weaver 63]] forming the [[Council of Weavers]], [[Exile|Ex-Weaver]] was defeated, and Exile himself banished to the [[Void Beyond]].

## Dark Star
A World-hopping [[Draconaster]] from the [[Darkstar]] Universe came, gasping for breath and only one star left in his cape, begging for help saving his universe. The [[Council of Weavers]], against [[Melbourne Weaver|The First Prime Weaver's]] advice, declined to help. When [[Melbourne Weaver|Weaver 63]] showed them that banishing Exile to the Void Beyond caused this, they reluctantly reconsidered. 
Upon arriving, the team dispatched to *Dark Star* found the [[Void Beyond]] tearing the [[Riverport (Metaverse)]] apart, threatening every Universe within. Dark Star Draconaster eventually gave the last of his Celestial energy to restart Sol, but the sky would never be the same. Grayson would take the cape, and the power that remained.
