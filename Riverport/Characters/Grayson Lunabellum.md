Also known as *Fenrir*, *The Wolf Arcane*

## [[The Monster at Summer Camp]]
Grayson, social outcast as most [Werewolves](Werewolf) are, is sent to Summer Camp at [[Lake Origin]]. It is here he first meets [[Lucas Kettleburn]] and [[Marion Baker X]], where they become friends, and band together to stop [[Sköll]] from unleashing an ancient curse.

## [[Veilwood Raid]]
Grayson and Lucas would continue their friendship through middle and high school, occassionally seeing Marion between her various extracurriculars and avoiding her Grandmother finding out. [[Marion Baker VIII]], leader of the [[Silver Bullets]], just like the Bakers back to the Age of Fairy Tales, despised werewolves.
The Lunabellums, at the time, lived in the [[Veilwood Charter]], a Werewolf themed community. A key component of the Charter was that the neighborhood was not to become "a nuisance", a nebulous term whose lack of definition would herald the end of the contract before it began. 
The Silver Bullets called on the Charter after the discovery of the [[Rogue's Gallery]]. Deciding that swift action would nip the problem before it spread to the rest of the city, they purged the neighborhood, killing a number of werewolves, but displacing all of them. This was the beginning of [[The Silver Wars]], and the schism that would eventually bring down the Silver Bullets.
Grayson, himself, was sleeping over at Lucas's on the night of the raid. He was suspicious when [[Nora Kettleburn]] recieved a call from his mother, but confirmed it on the news later. He would then run back to see his neighborhood burned down, [[Hati]] and Sköll amongst the ashes. Grayson attempted to console them, but this escalated the rivalry between Sköll and Grayson. The Kettleburns would then take Grayson in to let him finish high school and college.

## College Years
Grayson, predictably lost after the disappearance of his parents, who were never found after the Veilwood Raid, would be unfocused in college. Lucas would major in a number of fields, aided by his [[Artificier Gauntlets]], linked to the [[Babylon Archives]]. Grayson spent this time deciding who he would be, and took up the Fenrir mantle after hearing of increased crime in the area. It was also during this time that Lucas and Grayson began acknowledging their love for each other.
Grayson would go on to create [[Moonlight Investigations]], always hoping he can catch some hint of his parents, but vowing to help those who couldn't find help elsewhere.

## [[Moonbeams and Heartstrings]]
Lucas and Grayson would evolve their relationship, eventually getting engaged. They would invite the entire [[Weaver Network]] to their wedding.
The night before the ceremony, the happy couple's old friend, [[Marion Baker X]], showed up to warn them of the Silver Bullet's plan to destroy the wedding. Deciding that living in fear of the opressor would only let them win (and because every hero in Riverport was invited to the wedding), they persisted.
As if scheduled, just before the ceremony began, the Bullets invaded. It would take the strategic planning of every member of the Weaver Network to pull everyone through unscathed, but eventually Scarlet X and her crew of dissenters would stall the Bullets enough for ghe wedding to escape.
At Lake Origin, as if by fate, the two were wed, far from the meddling of [[Marion Baker VIII]].

## [[Blood Moon]]
Marion Baker VIII, humiliated by her recent defeat, hearing dissention in her ranks since the Veilwood Raid, was determined to show Riverport the monsters that they worshipped. Her perfect opportunity arrived in the form of the Berserker Comet, a strange astral anomaly that turned the moon blood red. It was this same comet, in the [[Riverport (Prime Canon)#Age of Fairy Tales]] that revealed to the original [[Marion Lee Baker]] her grandmother's true form, thus beginning the [[Silver Bullets]], then known as the Silver Arrows.
In modern times, however, the deranged Baker in charge of the modern Bullets knew this was the perfect time to expose the monsters in the 'heroes'.
She would kidnap any werewolf she could and experiment on them with concentrated Blood Moon energy, driving their Wolf Within wild. Grayson would be captured by the Red Hood, and taken to the remains of the [[OnceAgain Corporation]]. He struggled against the experiments until Lucan finally rescued him. The werewolf's stamina had ran out, though, and he succumbed to the monster.
Artificier would do the only thing he could think of and expell all of their spirits using a technique he learned from an old college friend, [[Tamashī Haiku]]. Lucas would take the Wolf Within into himself, able to hold him back with the [[Artificier Gauntlets]] until he could calm him, showing him the fear he had promised never to cause.

## Twin Soul Fenrir
While successful in controlling the Wolf Within, Artificier would cause a rift between Grayson and Fenrir. During this time, Fenrir would lash out against any percieved injustice. Coupled with other heroes struggling with the aftermath of Blood Moon, the team sought help from [[Tamashī Haiku|Soulmaurai]] and [[Draconaster]]. It was during this time that [[The Fray]] happens.
