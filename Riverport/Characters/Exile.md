Exile is a rogue Swarm Nanobot, once a part of [[Ark-Hive]]. It is his belief that in order to acquire all knowledge in universe, it must be taken by force. It is this belief that made him an exile, as Ark-Hive isolated that programming on a single nanobot and discarded it, intending for it to land in a star or burn up in an atmosphere.

## Hunter of Knowledge
His fixation on accruing knowledge comes from the directive he was programmed with when still a part of Ark-Hive. The Babylon Archive's entire goal was to accrue all knowledge in the universe. Any Archivist would admit it was an impossible goal to achieve what they called "Absolute Knowledge"
