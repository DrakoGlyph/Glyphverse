The Weaver Network is a team of heroes in the [[Riverport (Metaverse)]], founded by [[Melissa Weaver|Weaver]] to help protect the city from any threat. 

## Founding
Melissa Weaver first considered the need for a team of heroes after the first visit by [[Exile]]. She created a new saying "Save the City, the first suit's free", advertising her tailoring servies, offering a custom made super suit to any hero that manages to save Riverport. In  doing so, she would create a contact list of the heroes in Riverport, whom she could call on in times of crisis.
