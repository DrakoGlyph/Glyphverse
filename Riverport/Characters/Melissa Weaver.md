Also known as the *Weaver*
Has held the title *[[Prime Weaver]]*

Melissa Weaver is the current holder of the [[Book of Fate]], a powerful artifact able to grant the weilder the power to see, and modify, the very seams of the universe. 

## Before Powers
Melissa was originally unassuming, a humble tailor, as was her mother before her, and her grandmother before that. Her family had practiced all kinds of tailoring, weaving, and other fabric work through the ages. It was her grandmother who founded the shop, [[Weaver and Weaver Tailoring]], a shop to which Melissa devoted her life. She never assumed much of the various implements stored in the back closet, and was content to spend her days, as she was raised, trying to better herself and her community.
Her life, however, would be turned upside-down when her grandmother, whom she visited regularly, presented her with the family heirloom, The Book of Fate.

## [[Universe 63]]
Before Melissa could even get home, she was approached by [[Faux Pas]], who had been after the Weaver's powers for years. Melissa saw no way out. She didn't understand her powers, nor could she effectively use them against the villain. Cornered, the powers manifested themselves and dropped her into the [[Silk Roads]]. After some time, she would land, but not back in her universe. 
She was then confronted with the truth, there were other universes out there. The Weaver of this universe, [[Melbourne Weaver]], would help her understand her powers before helping her get back home. They then bound the back doors of their shops together, so Melbourne would never be far away if she ever needed help.

## Ark-Hive, Hunted
The hero [[Ark-Hive]] arrived on Earth 

## Ex-Weaver
Trapped at the end of [[Reckoning]], [[Exile]] took control of Weaver in a bid to unmake the universe so that he might create a new one in its stead, one where he had absolute knowledge.
As before, the powers of the Weaver autonomously activated, but with her body in control of Exile, only her Soul could make the journey, but she brought part of Exile's consciousness with her. She would proceed to fight back against Exile's control in the Silk Roads, affecting his control of her powers in the conflict.
Eventually, with the help of the newly formed [[Council of Weavers]], she would completely break free of Exile's control, and banish him beyond the Silk Roads, in the [[Void Beyond]].
