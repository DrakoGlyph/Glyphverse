Also known as *Mooneater*

Sköll is a delinquent [[Werewolf]] born in the [[Veilwood Charter]]. He is one of the villains of [[Riverport (Metaverse)]]

## Early Life
Sköll fell victim to terrible circumstances from the very beginning. With the growing dissent about Werewolves, especially the [[Werewolf Registration Act]], his parents were pushed even farther down. 
High school sweethearts pressured into marriage due to teenage pregnancy, Sköll's parents were doomed to a divorce. His father absent; his mother negligent. It left little to wonder how Sköll ended up at [[Rogue's Gallery]]. 

## [[The Monster at Summer Camp]]

Mischevious as he was, when Sköll found out there was supposedly a demon trapped in [[Lake Origin]], it was only a matter of time before he would endeavor to release it. His natural troublemaking would see him even further ostracized from his peers. Eventually, alone and unsupervised, he began the ritual, unwittingly opening the door for things to come.
The young members of [[Moonlight Investigations]], however, would stop him before the summoning was complete, and help him recontain the ancient evil.
His curiousity for the morbid and vile was piqued, unfortunately; his passion for the macabre would define his path.
It was also during this time that young [[Hati]] would seek to befriend him, hoping to bring him back to the light.

## [[Veilwood Raid]]

In what could only be described as the most horrifically traumatic event one never wishes a child (or in this case a self-sufficient teen) to witness, the [[Silver Bullets]] raided [[Veilwood Charter]] in, as they would declare, a "Consice attempt to nip the criminal underworld problem in the bud". Sköll had to watch as they killed his mother and burned his home, all while he was hidden across the street.
He was spotted, but by Officer [[Rick O'Sheigh]], who could no longer support the Silver Bullet cause. He made sure the Silver Bullets didn't find any of the werewolf children that night. After the ordeal was over, and his neighborhood left in ashes, Sköll broke. He would then pledge his allegiance to [[Faux Pas]], the only parental figure he ever respected, and helped her build the new Rogue's Gallery.
Sköll would take to petty theft at first, Hati always in tow trying to mitigate damage and casualty. Together they lived the life of urchins, but Faux Pas pushed Sköll, driving him further down the paths of vengeance and villainy. 
He was a regular adversary to Moonlight Investigations, but always just out of their reach, either thanks to his own rougish tendencies, or due to the help of the other members of Rogue's Gallery. All the money he could steal, however, never filled the hole in his heart. He longed for just one thing: his family to be whole.

## Partners in Crime

He would never realize himself, but Faux Pas had been grooming him, and she let slip about the [[Loom of Fate]], suggesting (incorrectly) that he could use it to bring his lost loved ones back.
Against Hati's opposition, Sköll decided he would try anyway. [[Melbourne Weaver]] would, in the ensuing fight, he would kill the [[Universe 63]] versions of himself and Hati, then set fire to [[Weaver and Weaver Tailoring]], taking the Loom of Fate. He attempted to use it, but in doing so nearly tore the [[Fabric of the Universe]] apart, an event known as [[The Fray]]. As consequence, the powers of the Weaver reacted and threw him, and Hati, into the [[Silk Roads]], where they would wander the Multiverse.

## Becoming Mooneater
Sköll, lost adrift in the endless plane, went insane. When he did finally fall into another universe, he sought out his alternate self, Hati trying to reason with him the whole time. When he did finally encounter the Sköll of this universe, he slew him where he stood, apparently draining the power from him, calling him an "Imposter". Spending so much time in the Silk Roads, however, had opened his (and Hati's) consciousness to the Multiverse, and the seams holding them together. He was then able to slip between them and went on a spree. In every universe, he would seek out the Hati and Sköll, slay them, and drain their power. This corrupted Sköll, until he was no longer the werewolf. His body melded with the shadows, and his mind was lost to the madness. Under the new name *Mooneater*, he sought to return to [[Riverport (Prime Canon)]] to exact his revenge.

## [[Ragnarok]]
When Mooneater finally returned to Prime Canon, he had been transformed completely. He was no longer a mortal being of flesh and blood, but a living manifestation of shadows incarnate. His return was predicted by [Sundancer](Hati) in her dreams.
Sköll, having eaten the moon, remained in darkness. Hati, having caught up to the sun, now dances in the light. The prophecy fulfilled, Ragnarok begins. 
Though she fought valiantly, the newly redeemed Hati was unable to destroy her former partner, letting him go free.

## [[Reckoning]]
Ever faithful to [[Faux Pas]], Mooneater would return to her before the fateful night. He was no more than a lapdog to her now, succumbing to the [[Wolf Within]]. Sköll was no more.
He would eventually go up against Sundancer again, but this time she was over him, having conquered him in her nighmares. He perished there, in her arms.
