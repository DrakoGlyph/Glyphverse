Also known as *Prime Universe*

*Prime Canon Riverport*, sometimes referred to as the *Prime Universe*, is the base of the [[Riverport (Metaverse)]].

It is based off this universe that changes are denoted of Alternates by the [[Council of Weavers]], like [[Universe 63]].

## Age of Babylon
Early in human history, the [[Babylon Archivists]] came to Earth to attempt to link them to the [[Grand Archives]]. The combined disasters of the Tower of Babylon and Library of Alexandria convinced the majority of the archivists to abandon the project, citing a general hostility toward collective knowledge amongst the population. Some Archivists would stay, motivated by the desire to collect all information, and blended in with humans to achieve that goal, collectively known as the [[Earth Archivists]].

## Age of Fairy Tales

The Black Forest, known locally as [[Swartzenwald]], is home to a large number of magical species, and it was particularly flourishing during the era, and spread through most of central Europe. In the First World War, much of it was lumbered, and used for the war efforts, endangering the magical denizens within, who wanted nothing to do with human wars.
It was mere months before World War II that Swartzenwald officially ceded from its hosting countries, and magically sealed itself off, preventing further damage to the forest.
