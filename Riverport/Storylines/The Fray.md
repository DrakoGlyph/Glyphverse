*The Fray* refers to both the unstable region in Central Riverport and the events that caused it. This article covers both. 

## Creation
When [[Sköll]] attempted to use the [[Loom of Fate]] to resurrect his parents, a feat he was warned by [[Melbourne Weaver|Weaver 63]] could not be completed, he tore the [[Fabric of the Universe]], the binding force of the [[Riverport (Metaverse)]], allowing the greater [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]] and [[Void Beyond]] to encroach into it. 

## Effects
One of the direct effects of the Veil of Infinite Possibilities entering the Riverport Metaverse was an upsurge in powered individuals, both good and not so good. [[Weaver Network]] did their best to intercept and mentor the individuals affected, but would not always reach them first. Some, such as Sköll, would be corrupted by the Void Beyond.
