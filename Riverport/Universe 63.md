Universe 63, otherwise known as Genderswap, is a [[Riverport (Prime Canon)]] AU centered around Rule 63. Each character has an inverted gender identity.

## Pre-merge
The history of Universe 63 is nearly identical to that of the [Prime Canon](Riverport%20(Prime%20Canon).md) up until [[Melissa Weaver]] falls through the [[Silk Roads]] after her first defeat by [[Faux Pas]], with the exception that [[Melbourne Weaver]] had obtained his [[Book of Fate]] from his Grandfather on his eighteenth birthday, allowing him to spend a significant amount of time learning his powers before encountering his first villain.

## [[Weaver and Weaver]]
When Melissa Weaver finds herself in Universe 63, it isn't long before she notices everything is familiar, but not quite the same. Her arrival pulls on the [[Threads of Fate]], alerting Melbourne. 
After a quick investigation, Melbourne explains the Weaver powers, and offers to teach Melissa how to use them. The only caveat is that a Weaver's powers only work in their home universe, as the Book of Fate is intristically tied to it.
They then hatch the plan to link the back door of their shops, so Melbourne can help teach Melissa.
