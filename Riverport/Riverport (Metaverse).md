## The Pocket Metaverse
When the [[Shards of Id]] broke off, Origin created worlds around each of them to protect them from [[Dro'ung]]. Riverport, whose shard fell into the [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]], kept producing alternate timelines, which the Shard contained in a barrier. This barrier exists outside of any Riverport universe, but does touch the Prime Riverport Universe at [[Lake Origin]], consequently the location of the Shard of Id.
