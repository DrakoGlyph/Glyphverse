At the creation of the [[Glyphverse]], there was only one thing, the Veil of Infinite Possibilites. This primordial energy manifested an Avatar, known as [[Origin]]. Origin created [[Glyphsid]], and all that lies within it, but as his creations grew, he tired of the older, outdated creations. That was the creation of the [[Void Beyond]], a space for things to *end*.
