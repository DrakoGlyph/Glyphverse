At the creation of the [[Glyphverse]], there was only one thing, the Veil of Infinite Possibilites. This primordial energy manifested an Avatar, known as [[Origin]]. Origin created [[Glyphsid]], and all that lies within it, but as his creations grew, he tired of the older, outdated creations. That was the creation of the [[Void Beyond]], a space for things to *end*. Origin would decree that all things must end, that is the nature of existance, for things either will be, are now, or have been, there is no *forever*.
It was then that the Element of Destruction manifested in greater quantities then ever before: the [[Glyphs of the Elements|Glyph of Destruction]] had been created in the Void beyond, and thus the beginning of the eternal war of creation and destruction began.
