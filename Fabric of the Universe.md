The Fabric of the Universe exists as a singular unit, a component of the [[Silk Roads]], the [[Xenomyr]], and of the greater [[Veil of Infinite Possibilities]]. 

Conceptually, it is a singular universe's probability. One could compare it to an RNG Seed, or an individual's DNA. Each universe's fabric is unique, distinct for the same reasons that universe is unique.
Collections of Fabrics can be seen in Riverport (Silk Roads) and Jramir (Xenomyr), binding subsets of the multiverse together. Collections like these are often defined by their shared attributes. As an example, every variant of the constituent Fabrics in the Silk Roads contains a version of Riverport.
